          <p class="lead">The gear box is the second element of the power train in an automobile. It is used to change the speed and torque of vehicle according to variety of road and load condition. A gear box changes the engine speed into torque when climbing hills and when the vehicle required. Sometimes it is known as torque converter. </p>

          <p>Main functions of a gear box is as follow-</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Provide the torque needed to move the vehicle under a variety of road and load conditions. It does this by changing the gear ratio between the engine crankshaft and vehicle drive wheels.</li>
            <li>Be shifted into reverse so the vehicle can move backward.</li>
            <li>Be shifted into neutral for starting the engine.</li>
          </ol>
          <hr>


          <h2>Components Of Gear Box</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Counter shaft</li>
            <li>Main shaft</li> 
            <li>Gears</li>
            <li>Bearings</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In a gear box, the counter shaft is mashed to the clutch with a use of a couple of gear. So the counter shaft is always in running condition. When the counter shaft is brought in contact with the main shaft by use of meshing gears, the main shaft starts to rotate according to the gear ratio. When want to change the gear ratio, simply press the clutch pedal which disconnect the counter shaft with engine and is then connected to the main shaft with counter shaft by another gear ratio by use of the gearshift lever. In an gear box, the gear teeth and other moving metal must not touch. They must be continuously separated by a thin film of lubricant. This prevents excessive wear and early failure. Therefore a gearbox runs partially filled with lubricant oil.</p>

          <h3>1.Countershaft:</h3>
          <p>Counter shaft is a shaft which connects with the clutch shaft directly. It contains the gear which connects it to the clutch shaft as well as the main shaft.</p>

          </figure>

          <h3>2.Main Shaft:</h3>
          <p>It is the shaft which runs at the vehicle speed. It carries power form the counter shaft by use of gears and according to the gear ratio, it runs at different speed and torque compares to counter shaft.</p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">Mainshaft. Photo: thebusinesstactics.com</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3>3.Gears:</h3>
          <p>Gears are used to transmit the power form one shaft to another. They are most useful component of transmission box because the variation is torque of counter shaft and main shaft is depend on the gear ratio. The gear ratio is the ratio of the driven gear teeth to the driving gear teeth. If gear ratio is large than one, the main shaft revolves at lower speed than the counter shaft and the torque of the main shaft is higher than the counter shaft. On other hand if the gear ratio is less than one, than the main shaft revolves at higher speed than the counter shaft and the torque of the main shaft is lower than the counter shaft. A small car gear box contains four speed gear ratio and one reverse gear ratio.</p>

          </figure>

          <h3>4.Bearing:</h3>
          <p>Whenever the rotary motion, bearings are required to support the revolving part and reduce the friction. In the gear box both counter and main shaft are supported by the bearing.</p>
          <hr>

          <h2>Basic Idea</h2>

          <p>One can run, but with less energy, by pedaling on a bike he will move faster. That's the whole concept of a gear box, to optimise the use of a vehicle engine for the desired task: speed or force.
          <p>When vehicle starts moving and accelerate, more force (or torque) is required, while the speed is low. It has to overcome a lot of inertia (vehicle wants to stay stationary).</p>
          <p>When running at the desired speed, the force required is less, it has to overcame just the friction, not the inertia.</p>
          <p>Inertia force occurs when speed is changed, either accelerating or braking.
          Now we know that vehicle speed can vary between 5 to max speed of (lets say) 150 km/h.</p>
          <p>That means a ratio of 30. The max speed is 30 times more than minimum speed.
          The usual gasoline engine has a crankshaft that rotates and by coupling to it we can get the power out of the engine. The usual usable RPM range of the crankshaft is 1000 to 5000 rpm.</p>
          
          <figure class="figure mx-auto d-block" style="text-align:center;">
          <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="images/crankshaft.jpg" alt="Gearbox" style="display:inline-block;">
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">Engine Crankshaft Bearing. Photo: aa1car.com</figcaption>
          </figure>
          

          <p>As you can see the ratio is 5, means that max speed will be only 5 times higher than minimum speed.
          OK, but we need a ratio of 30, the available 5 is not enough.
          Here the gear box gets in the game.</p>
          <p>The gear box is located between the engine & clutch and the driveaxles & wheels.</p>
          <p>In the gear box we will find sets of gears that the driver (or automatic in other vehicles) can select in order to start moving, accelerate or maintain the speed. Is called shifting gears.
          In the first gear, the speed range is 5 to 25 km/h, in the second we can go from 10 to 50 km/h, the third from 20 to 100 km/h and so on.</p>
          <p>In the 5th we can go from 50 to 150 only because the overall engine power to overcome friction is limited. The more power the bigger the max speed, close to ratio of 5 times more than 50 km/h.
          It is a must to have the speed ranges overlapped in order to have good drivability characteristics. You can drive at 50 km/h in the 4th gear and maintain that speed, but barely accelerate, and when in need to accelerate shift in 3rd and you are still in range but have more torque to overcome the inertia.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the low gears you can enjoy fast acceleration but low speeds, in high gears you can mostly maintain the speed.
          <p>On a side note, on the big semi trucks the power band is in the RPM range from 1400 to 1700 rpm. Very low ratio. That's the reason these vehicles have 18 speeds, to keep the engine in the power band at practically any traffic speed.
